# Simple Hardhat Project

# 💸 FundMe DApp

Welcome to **FundMe**, a decentralized application (DApp). This project demonstrates the power of smart contracts deployed on the blockchain using **Hardhat** with a sleek, simple frontend to let users interact easily. Let’s walk you through how it works and how you can get it up and running.

## 📖 What is FundMe?

**FundMe** is a smart contract that allows users to:
- Only the contract owner can withdraw funds.

Our website interface lets you easily send funds and view funds, all powered by the Ethereum blockchain!

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Solidity**: Smart contract
- **Hardhat**: Development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts

- **Web3Modal**: Seamless wallet connection (like MetaMask)


## 🚀 Features

- **Deposit ETH**: Connect your wallet and contribute to the FundMe contract.

- **Withdraw Funds**: Only the owner can withdraw the total funds.


## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Contributors**: Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can connect to the website and contribute ETH.
2. **Contract Owner**: Only the contract owner has the permission to withdraw funds.
3. **Transparency**: Contributions are recorded on the blockchain, visible to anyone.
